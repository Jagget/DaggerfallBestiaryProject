# DaggerfallBestiaryProject
Graphics dump for use with new enemies in Daggerfall Unity.

New to github. Lets check things out. I'll be starting with prepping Arena sprites for use in Daggerfall.
I'll list the Arena bestiary with the progress so far of each monster.

----------------------------------
Elder Scrolls: Arena
----------------------------------
Stats for each monster can be found here: https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Arena:Monsters

(6/4/22) - Removing some entries for foes we will not use due to their presences in DF and being too ugly for use as a varient.

----------------------------------
Monsters
----------------------------------
Goblin - (Needs work) Remade with Oblivion Mesh asset. (Being remade with Morrwind assets)

Lizard Man - (DONE) Using Original Assets
----------- (Armored Lizard Man Varient Included)

Wolf - (Needs work) Will be made from Morrwind Assets
----------- Snow Wolf as Varient
----------- Hell Hound as Varient

Minotaur - (X) Will be made from oblivion assets.

Spider - (X) Use as a Varient. Need to split frames.

--------------------------------------

Unused graphics that can be reused again. All known sprites are ripped.
Just need to put them together.

--------------------------------------

Graphics of enemies unused in game, but exist in the files.

Horse Riders (DONE) - All sets are in, and are ready to go.
